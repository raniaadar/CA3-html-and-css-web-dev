Design Report
By Rania Dar (Student ID: 52320854)

Navigation: 
- I went for a simple navigation bar that runs on every page of the website with three separate headings for the main components: Home, Visit, and History.
- By adding a "hover" effect and using the "transition" property in CSS, I made it so that when you place your mouse over the navigation bar items, it displays a red line
  underneath them. This allows for the design of the nagivation bar to be more sleek and modern, as well as creating a better user experience.
- Alongside the main pages, I also included a "Contact Us" page which can be accessed through a "Contact" button located on the "Home" page. This makes the design more client-
  friendly as they can easily find out how to contact the company and put in any requests or questions they have.
- For the design of the "Contact" button I used CSS to style the button as well as adding a "hover" and "transition" (similar to the navigation bar) so that when you hover
  over the button, it turns red.
- For the static map, I downloaded the image from OpenStreetMap and resized it accordingly, first by cropping the image on my computer, then using CSS properties like width to
  resize it accordingly.

Layout:

"Home" Page:
- I wanted to include a large banner that would instantly attract attention. I chose to have large text and a banner that spans fully along the width of the page, as well as
  including the founding date and city slogan so that it entices the users to read on further about the Tourist Association.
- I attempted to use catchy phrasing like "Adventure Awaits" in order to make it a more authentic tourist experience.
- I included boxes of text first, describing key information that tourists visiting the city should know: where the city is, what it's known for, the range of attractions
  offered, and what kind of community resides there.
- I added another type of hover effect to the information boxes by using the "box-shadow" property which adds more depth to the page.
- Below the information boxes I added another section made specifically for users who want to see where they can explore the city further.
- In this section I added 3 side by side images with rounded corners: the static map to give a full overview of the heart of the city, as well as the most visited and popular
  tourist attractions like the beach.
- I added another transition on these images so that when you hover over any of them, text will slide up from the bottom and the image will turn red. I did this by setting
  the intial background to "transparent" and then setting the hover to a red colour.
- If you go down further you'll find a large box which contains the "Contact" button, which I already discussed under "Navigation". I decided to make this stand out more
  with larger text.
- Finally, at the bottom of the page I included a footer which I used to display the association's message/goal.
- The aim of the "Home" page is to sum up some facts about the city itself and which kind of travellers it might be suited for more. If the user finds they're interested,
  they can then navigate to either the "History" or "Visit pages, additionally if they have any questions, they can easily reach out to the Assocation via the "Contact"
  button.

"History" Page:
- On this page I included a picture that captured the essence of the "Granite City" and paired it with a brief history of the city.
- Like before, this page also includes the same footer with the association message.
- This page informs the user of the rich culture and history behind the city. Many users will want to then find out about monuments and attractions that the city has to offer
  and so the "History" page is a good transition into the "Visit" page which details the places users might be interested in visiting.

"Visit" Page: 
- On the "Visit" page I went for three main headings: Attractions, Dining and Accommodation.
- I included some main visual photos to give the user a general idea of what kind of city this is and under that, included brief descriptions on the range of experiences on
  offer.
- I considered that different users may have different needs when visiting this city and so made sure to include options for people travelling with their families and
  tourists who may have dietary restrictions or are on a tight budget. This is important as it makes the opportunity to travel and reach out to the Association much higher
  if it targets multiple groups of people rather than just a specific demographic. It will increase traffic on the site and give the Association more room to grow.

"Contact Us" Page:
- This page includes a phone number, email, and location of the Assocation's offices, giving users a multitude of ways to reach out and arrange visits or tours of the city.
- The design is kept simple and straight to the point so that the process of contacting the Assocation is not overcomplicated and is accessible to everyone from a simple
  glance at their screen.

Colour Choices:

- I chose to go with reds, white, black, and grey. This is mainly because the Aberdeen Football Club's colours are red and white and football in itself is a huge part of
  Aberdeen's culture and identity so many people who live here already associate the colour red with the city itself.
- On places I wanted to highlight, I used darker reds with white text to really make that section stand out. I utilised this strategy for the titles of each page, the
  navigation bar and the Contact button, where I used a dark grey so user's could clearly see it among the other components of the page.
- Meanwhile for the information boxes I used a lighter red and chose to put much less attention on the footer which user's generally won't pay attention to and isn't as
  important in attracting new users or increasing traffic to the website.

Challenges Faced:

- I learned how to make transitions in CSS for this which wasn't taught in class, so getting the hang of how the transition property worked alongisde with hover was kind of
  difficult at first but it made sense as I kept going.
- The Bootstrap features were harder to implement compared to the classic HTML and CSS properties.
